	<h1>Hey you ðŸ‘‹</h1>
	<p>
		I'm a a 23 year old computer engineer based in Brazil. I've been working as a software engineer
		for over 3 years. Currently doing a master's degree in computer science and computational
		mathematics, developing research in the field of time series data mining. Also doing a MBA in
		software engineer. If you want to reach me, feel free to contact through my email <a
			href="mailto:hi@minari.xyz">hi@minari.xyz</a
		>.
	</p>
	<p>
		I created this page to share notes about anything that I like. I'm currently interested in
		databases, data mining, complex networks and compilers. From time to time I have a crush on
		quantum computing. Don't be scared if you find other stuff non-tech related.
