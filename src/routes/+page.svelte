	<h1>Hey there ðŸ‘‹</h1>
	<p>
		I'm a 23-year-old computer engineer based in Brazil. I've been working as a software engineer
		for over 3 years. I'm currently studying a master's degree in computer science and computational
		mathematics, focusing the research on time series data mining. I'm also doing an MBA in software
		engineering. If you want to reach out, feel free to contact me through my email:

	<p>
		I created this page to share notes about anything that I like. Don't be surprised if you find
		other non-tech-related stuff here.
